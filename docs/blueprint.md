# **App Name**: StockWise

## Core Features:

- Product Tracking: Allow users to track the quantity and location of products in their inventory.
- Stock Alerts: Set up alerts for when stock levels are low, so users can reorder in time.
- Reporting: Generate reports on inventory levels and stock movements. These reports can be displayed on a dashboard, and/or be made downloadable in CSV format.
- Automated Summarization: Generate AI-driven summaries of stock levels. The LLM tool uses reasoning to identify items at risk of stockout, and/or to discover anomalies in the logs of recent inventory changes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke a sense of trust and reliability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), almost white, for a clean, uncluttered workspace.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#8E24AA) to bring a spot of color that complements the deep blue.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' for clear readability and a modern, friendly feel.
- Use simple, line-based icons to represent product categories and actions.
- Use a grid-based layout for a well-organized inventory display.
- Use subtle transitions to give feedback on user actions, such as adding or removing stock.
