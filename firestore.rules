/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces public read access to 'products' and 'loans' collections,
 * with write access entirely disabled as no authentication is required by the application.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information. Publicly readable.
 * - /loans/{loanId}: Stores loan information. Publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: Both 'products' and 'loans' collections are publicly readable, making their data accessible to anyone.
 * - No Write Access: All write operations (create, update, delete) are explicitly denied due to the absence of authentication providers in the application configuration.
